### Hey there, I'm Paul 👋

I am a big tech enthusiast, a passionate entrepreneur, and a web developper 🧑🏻‍💻

I am creative mind, always fond about building beautiful innovative products with the potential to change the world, a line of code at a time. After graduating and working in Finance and Real Estate, I decided to start a new journey in tech. That's when I decided to hop on the Wagon and get on the Rails 🛤

User journey | Prototyping in Figma | DB Schema and PostgreSQL | MVC pattern with Ruby on Rails | Auth. with Devise | Javascript + Stimulus JS | Geocoding with Mapbox | Action cable | Active record | PG Search | SCSS | GitHub | Cloudinary | Heroku
